# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This README summarizes OctoAcme's project management approach and provides quick links to all core process docs.

## Summary of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme manages projects through structured phases, clear roles, defined workflows, repeatable communication cadences, and continuous improvement. This approach is designed to scale institutional knowledge, ensure quality, and accelerate onboarding.

### Core Phases
- **Initiation:** Validate project need, define goals/success, align stakeholders, initial one-pager.
- **Planning:** Kickoff meeting, backlog prioritization, estimation, risk/dependency identification, and release timeline.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Daily standups, tracked status in GitHub Projects, quality gates (CI, PRs, testing), escalations, and demos.
- **Risk & Communication:** Ongoing risk assessment, Risk Register, clear stakeholder updates, and escalation paths.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardized deployment flows, checklists, and stakeholder announcements.
- **Retrospective & Improvement:** Always follow up with retrospectives, capture actions, and drive iterative improvement for every milestone.

### Roles / Personas
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and team communication.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines goals, prioritizes backlog, measures success.
- **Developers:** Implement features and quality, participate in planning and reviews.
- **QA/Testing:** Validate releases and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide input, feedback, and approvals.

### Communication & Quality Assurance
- Daily standups, weekly PM-PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure alignment.
- Workflows enforce tested, reviewed code and tracked progress.
- Risk Register updated weekly; issues escalate through documented levels.
- Regular retrospectives keep processes effective and evolving.
